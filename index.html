            <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
        
        <p>I'm currently inspecting communication and computer systems for the United States Navy.  I plan on 
            continuing with the Navy for the next 7 years in order to earn a second retirement. My main professional goal 
            while working for the Navy is to be promoted to GS-14 and be a civilian supervisor.  I have currently been training 
            as a deck manager and already a subject matter expert in most communication systems.  The Computing Applications 
            degree will help me with the computer software side of the house.<p>

        <p>When I retire from my Navy civilian career, I would like to use the degree to do some part time work in retirement, 
            whether it would be as a contractor or start my own business doing computer repair and or website creation.  I won't 
            be in a position that I have to work due to my Navy active duty and civilian retirements, but I would like to continue
            to have a purpose and work part time.</p>
